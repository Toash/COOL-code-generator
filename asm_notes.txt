COOL ASM STACK MACHINE CONVENTION:

Calling convention - on function exit, sp is same as it was on entry.
- In cool-asm, we add to stack  pointer  (deallocating parameters, receiver object and temporaries) in the function itself.
    (because the reference compiler does it :/ )
- in x86, we add to rsp after  the funcdtion caller (from the caller itself).
- the cool-asm reference compilter needs to add one to temporaries becauase it pops r0.

On function call,
- push parameters on stack
- push receiver object.
- x86 return address  gets pushed as well during call.
